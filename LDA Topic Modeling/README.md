LDA is an unsupervised learning method that maximizes the probability of word assignments to one of K fixed topics. <br>
The topic meaning is extracted by interpreting the top N probability words for a given topic. <br>
LDA will not output the meaning of topics, rather it will organize words by topic to be interpreted by the user. <br>
Application can be found here: https://rontomer.shinyapps.io/LDA_topic_modeling/ <br>
Or run this in R, `shiny::runGitHub("Shiny", "rontomer", subdir = "LDA Topic Modeling")`
